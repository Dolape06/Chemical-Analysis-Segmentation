# Chemical-Analysis-Segmentation
An advanced Unsupervised Learning project that classifies wine varieties using chemical constituents. By leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Hierarchical Clustering for structure validation, this model provides a data-driven approach to quality control and cultivar identification.
